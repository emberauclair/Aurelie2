Crescenda to Crescendo

I am a fighter. Not literally, but I have fought for and won control of my life. I come from a family that was strongly against LGBTQ+, I was raised in isolation and homeschooled up until college. I didn't know what I wanted in life because I didn't have any experience in the real world, so I let my parents tell me where to go to college. I started at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2019, and the residential life was eye opening in terms of gaining my independence.. It was a completely different lifestyle, and I learned to be self-reliant. 

I took on my identity as my own person during that first year. There were several key realizations: Firstly, I was not an engineer and yet I was at an engineering school. Secondly, I am trans. Because I’m from a conservative family, coming to terms with being trans was absolutely the hardest thing I've ever done. I knew that I could not come out to my family - they would not support me. My university also stifled my identity, with little to no resources in terms of diversity, and I was the only trans person on campus to my knowledge. I felt as though I had no way out. My roommates and parents were homophobic. I was terrified I’d be attacked,  I was miserable. I couldn't safely transition. I was close to giving up. 

At some point, I realized that I had gained enough essential life skills to be able to leave the abusive environment and have a good chance of succeeding. I spent about a month planning everything before flying to New York City. Leaving was a huge relief. I am able to function as my own person, transition, I’m with people who support me instead of hate me.

I lived in emergency housing at a shelter while I worked out benefits such as health insurance, medication, and housing. I found a free sailboat named Crescenda on Craigslist, which I then fixed up, and I'm currently writing this essay from. It doesn't have electricity, running water, or heat, but I have thick blankets, and it's better than the emergency housing at the shelter. Even though you may think that these are rather poor living conditions, I am wealthier than most in terms of freedom. I have sacrificed a lot of time and energy to get to a place where I can live out my own life and transition.
