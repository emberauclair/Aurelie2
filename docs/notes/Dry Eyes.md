[[Landing]] [[My Poems]]
Dry Eyes
.
.
.
Dry eyes, vacant stares,
Broken sky’s, shattered airs,
Crowded minds, lonely thoughts,
Wistful longings, casting lots,
Muddy futures, crystal dreams,
Aimless life, winding streams.
My existence, barely begun,
I've got two feet, but nowhere to run. 
I'm a kid in a bubble,
And I've got a bag of trouble

-Aurélie 2021
