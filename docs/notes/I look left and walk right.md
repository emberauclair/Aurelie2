[[Landing]] [[My Poems]]
tw suicide, self harm
I look left and walk right
.
.
.
I look left yet I walk right
I join the wrong fight
abdication is in my blood
I know I'm no better than mud
eternal regrets set in stone
cause I walk my life alone
I wield a knife against my skin
maybe it will lessen my sin
All is right, I know it's good
my life, my death, in the hood
I want to vanish- never seen again
I want to leave this world of sin
weakness flows through my veins
I cant bring myself to jerk the reins
