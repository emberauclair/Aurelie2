[[landing]]
Severed cries and echoing Sighs
.
.
.
Severed cries and echoing sighs
Rising upwards out of the blackness
Serving as an eternal warning
For those poor greedy souls
You think you can beat the odds
But the odds will always win
I know a trick, it’s not to win
But I’ll never fall in. 
Don't even start, 
cause once you do
It might be the last thing you finish
It will finish you.

-Aurélie, 2020
