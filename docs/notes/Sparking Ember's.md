[[Landing]] 
Forward: this selection of poems was written between March-2020, through July-2022. A laugh a smile, A crush, a blush. Introspection, word paintings, fantasy. Heartbreak, Mental illness, Emptiness. This is my best attempt to capture these feelings, bottle them up, and ink them on a page.
