The Best: A Lament for the Unloved

You've made it clear 
You don't want to hear 
What I have to say 
You don't want to see my face 
You don't want to hold my hand 
You just don't care if I leave or if I stay

Well, I wish the world for you 
I love you so 
So I'm letting you go 
You've taken my heart 
You're leaving me broken 
I wish the world for you

You deserve so much better 
Someone better than me 
You're perfect in every single way 
So I'm letting you go 
'Cause you don't want me

I'll fade away softly 
With tears in my eyes 
In the deepening night 
Drowning in the world 
Foundering in the crowds 
Wishing the best for you

Maybe I'll find another 
Perhaps I can be better 
Why can't I be perfect 
So you could notice me

  
Inspiration- 2020 quarantine summer: roughest time of my life so far.
