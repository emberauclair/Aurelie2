description: finding yourself is a nightmare

#poem 



Sparkling darkness and shining shadows
Hooded eyes shine softly in the glowing mists
There is captivating mystery in those sparkling eyes
for what lies behind that gaze?
Who could say? Not I, nay.


I take a step closer as the shadows shift
A hooded figure, robed in shadows stands in the rift
Ultramarine - the darkest blue eyes glowing
Another step and the shadows retreat 

She has a crown - a simple affair 
She wears a look of utter despair 
She reveals a bloody knife
Itâ€™s been used to take a life

I stare into the jagged rift
I turn away in pain.
I have found me
