a piece of advice
.
.
.
here is a thought, its not much of one really,
but I'll tell it to you anyway
be kind to the ones you love 
For sooner or later they will rise
And for better or worse, it will be too late
So make sure you tell your love 
Every day every hour if itâ€™s within your power
Kiss your love slowly. 
Savor their taste on your lips
Remember forever 
Make the most of your love
