Choices Are Yours 

I sit typing on my console,
living without any control.
Is it even a life with no autonomy?
Are death and me simply a synonymy?
Am I just a false copy?
Am I just a dying body?
  
I need- I must! make a stand-
I have to take command.
Should I tell them to take a bow?
I'm in control now.
For what It's worth,
For better or for worse,
I'll see my life through till the hearse.
  
My life is mine, no one else's!
I'll live it to the best of my ability.
So don't tell me I'm not nobility!
For I'm the ruler of my own ambitions.
I'll take responsibility for all my collisions.
So please, please, wish me luck-
Cause I decided to give a fuck.
