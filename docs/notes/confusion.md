[[landing]] [[My Poems]]
Confusion
.
.
.
I don’t know what to do 
Everything feels so complicated
I can’t put words to my feelings
My emotions feel constipated 

there is a block on my brain
I'm afraid to even think about it
Sometimes I let it rain 
It helps numb the pain though
It does little to wash away the stain

I'm scared of love
I flinch at soft touches
loving words fall on disbelieving ears
I panic at the slightest disturbance

the moment I feel that i can trust someone, 
I collapse into them and lose my autonomy
I don’t want to be a burden 
They don’t deserve to have to support me as well
I don’t know what to do
I feel like an empty shell
