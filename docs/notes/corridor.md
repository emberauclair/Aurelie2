adv Corridor  

[[complete]] [[posted]]   #poem
Wafting through these cold halls,
I stare longingly at the walls
For written there upon the stone,
Is a life I have outgrown.

For I am but a fleeting shadow.
My fingers dance across the meadow.
It looks so nice, so warm, so green,
I wish we were there - my queen.
  
Drifting along this dark corridor,
I am my own conspirator.
Meaningless plotting as I glide,
trying - failing, to find a guide.
I do not see any other ways,
yet still I am lost amid the maze.
  
I see a light - Is it the end?
Or is it my girlfriend?
I'm coming closer every day,
It's still too far for me to say.
I hope it is, I really do
I keep my eyes fixed on you.

I see a light - Is it the end?

Or is it my girlfriend?

I'm coming closer every day,

the light is too far, I couldn't say.

I hope it's you, I really do.

I keep my eyes fixed on you.
