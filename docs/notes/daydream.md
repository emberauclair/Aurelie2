Daydream
.
.
.
Pure and smooth, the gray silk flows
like the wild ocean, It ripples and billows
No rhyme or pattern, as it twists and turns.
As I stare, I begin to see the depths of the treachery 
Written on silk, billowing on waves 
it permeates the graves

The graves are like grey silk waves,
rolling across the pure white snow
poking softly through the snow, the Lily’s grow 
like whitecaps on a storm tossed sea
Celebrating the insanity 

-Aurélie, 2021
