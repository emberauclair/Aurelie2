distractions

I stare at the whiteboard: its not quite straight,
my foot begins to shake.
I stare at the whiteboard: its not quite white,
my heart races at the sight. x
This whiteboard has a history,
millions of lines drawn and erased.
millions of colors interlaced.
thousands of stories taught to blank faces
It’s all blended together.
  
I hear someone rustle the pages of their book,
I turn my head to sneak a quick look.
I don’t find who made the noise,
Instead, i see a boy in restful poise.
His chin is resting on his hand,
his pen is about to descend.
His hair has fallen into his eyes,
and he lets out the smallest of sighs.
Oh! he caught me staring!
I remember that we are in class,
and turn back around with a blush.
