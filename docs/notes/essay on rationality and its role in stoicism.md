# essay on rationality and its role in stoicism

## Introduction
I'm writing this essay mainly for myself to help clarify my own thoughts on these philosophies. I think that careful thought about what you believe is essential to knowing your purpose in life. I will first give a definition, and an example of each philosophy, and then dive into the differences between them. 

## rationality
In order to dissect the role that rationality has in stoicism, one must first have a firm grasp on what rationality is. I will seek to write a concise description of rationality. the textbook definition claims that it is **The view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge.**  For example, a rationalist will usually flat out refuse to believe things that do not have a basis in the scientific method, or require faith. 
## stoicism
**Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions.** For example - A stoic when confronted with an injustice would seek to put on a calm and collected face, and negotiate the problem, without releasing emotions such as anger, frustration or hate, instead seeking to exhibit compassion, understanding, and patience. 

Imagine… say, someone treats you in a way that you perceive as unfair. An emotional reaction would cause you to escalate the situation and perhaps yell at the person. If the person had more self control, then they might perhaps hold back the emotions in recognition that they will not help the situation, and will not achieve anything positive. A rationalist would seek to make the most rational decision regarding the conflict. Walk away? Escalate if needed? perhaps go find the manager and complain? A Stoic would accept the situation as it is, and perhaps if future interactions with this person are likely, would seek to either repair the relationship, or take steps to avoid interaction with this person. 

I personally believe that escalating the situation is almost always a bad thing. I believe that this leans more towards a stoic view of the world. 

I however believe that if I could get the person who mistreated me fired, that would keep them from mistreating myself again, and also keep them from mistreating others. I think this is more of a rationalist approach. I think that this goes against stoicism, since this uses a potentially destructive emotion (revenge). 

I think based on these examples that rationalists can also be stoics, in the fact that rationality requires a High amount of self-control, and emotional control. However stoicism differs on the fact that Rationalists embrace all emotions as long as they make sense from a logical standpoint. I'd argue that Rationalism is a less restrictive form of stoicism, with a focus on making logical, informed decisions. 

## Difficulties
The mind is inherently illogical, and most people are not rational. they do what feels best instead of what is actually best for them.
Examples include people saying that they'd like to live as long as possible, be as productive as possible, and be as healthy as possible. but failing miserably at all of them. [[how to live as long as possible]]

However those same people hardly walk anywhere, eat high sugar high calorie diets, are overweight, and refuse to spend the time needed to be highly organized to maximize their productivity, and are woefully ignorant on what will maximize their lifespan. I believe that it takes Immense effort, an Unreal amount of self-control, and an obsessive interest in these philosophies to even begin to live them out

## requirements for Rationality
A thirst for knowledge
A really good form of note taking or a photographic memory
Obsessive detail oriented tendencies 
Willingness to go against society and challenge the norms
Determinedness 
A willingness to be an outcast

## Conclusion:
I think that rationality and stoicism blend together really well. they really only have a few subtle differences, and they tend to focus on similar ideas
