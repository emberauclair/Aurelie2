[[Landing]]  [[My Poems]] 

fingerprints 
.
.
.
you left your fingerprints 
  all over my soul
I can't erase it
I don't want to
you left your fingerprints
   deep in my heart

You changed me, dear
You seared my soul
   You cant 
   take it back
my heart will always remember 
   your touch
I will always remember 
   the rush
Its gone now though
I wish for your touch.
