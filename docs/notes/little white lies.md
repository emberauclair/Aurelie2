Little white lies

[[complete]] [[posted]]   [[favorite]] #poem [[sad]]

Little white lies, 
They go quite nice with a burger and fries.
They taste so sweet, 
Like a little guilty treat.
It doesn't seem to cause any harm,
It creeps up causing no alarm.
One day I wake up,
My world is in ruins.
I realize that I've built an empire of lies,
It stretches to the top of the skies.
I'm drowning in the tears from your eyes.
