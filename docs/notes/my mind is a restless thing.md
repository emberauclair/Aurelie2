My mind is a restless thing

My mind is a restless thing,
it chooses its own path.
Leaping swiftly from winter to spring,
changing from calm to wrath
  
in the space of a breath.
Ever lurking in my mind
is a feeling of death.
I feel like I’m blind-
  
but I’m not. 
I’m missing something vital.
I haven’t got a thought 
of what it might entitle.
  
A constant worry is lingering.
It deepens my eyes and muffles my smile.
I don't have an inkling,
I just live and pretend in style.
