# Small Sad Smile :)

I glance up when you walk into the room.
I see you standing in the gloom.
I give you a small, sad smile,
and it speaks of trials by the mile.
All the hardships, all the pain,
it weighs heavily upon my brain.
  
What can I do?
What shall I say? 
What can make the pain go away? 
I simply smile, and hide away-
All of the pain beneath my gaze. 
  
Is it real- this pain I feel?
Is it right? Do I deserve my plight?
It fucking keeps me up at night. 
When I'm quiet, smiling without a laugh-
It's cause I'm trying not to break in half.
