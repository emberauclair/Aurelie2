# snow  

You came into my life promising happiness and beauty,  
Only for me to be scarred with your envy.  
The seeping cold penetrates my skin,  
And now my heart's frozen.  
But now that you’re truly gone,  
I can finally see the dawn.  
The aching shards of your love,  
catch the morning rays above.  
I can see the beauty of-  
the icicles which form from my tears.  
Because as my heart begins to thaw
and the icicles start to fall,  
I still feel your touch on my soul.

  
Like snow that hasn’t completely melted,  
You're still there guiding me to fresh blossoms.  
The exquisite scents are compelling,  
They make me tired as I lay down to sleep.  
The freezing ground pierces my face,  
It’s comforting the way it spreads its pain.  
I sleep and awake to green grass   
And I see the bushels of flowers that you led me to   
White daffodils   
They’re innocent? The harsh cold hasn't damaged them yet.  
The way the sun bounces off of them   
As though they deserve to shine.

From persevering the winters bite

I breathe in the spring air.  
I haven’t done that in a while.  
I’m finally able to breathe

  
You left,  
And now I’m scared-  
of what might happen.  
You brought me to something I could never dream of,  
You stranded me in this beautiful wasteland.  
I want to you back   
The cold was comforting-

I knew the pain and the hurt.  
I didn’t expect anything more,  
But you were fulfilling,

yet I was too blind to see.  
Now you're gone  
And   
I miss you.
