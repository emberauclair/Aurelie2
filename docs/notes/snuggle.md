# snuggle


I fall asleep with my head on your chest.  
I snuggle into you as we rest.
I murmur softly in your ear,
all the things you love to hear.
I whisper softly - "you warm my heart"
I squeeze you tighter - I don’t want to part. 
I breathe in deep, with a shiver of joy,
You’re all I want, you’re my favorite toy. 
I hug my stuffie a little tighter and fall asleep :)
