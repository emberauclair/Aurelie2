aau strike-through [[favorite]] [[complete]] #poem 

  

i can barely find the strength to say
woe is me on this deathly day
I care so much and caring hurts
my thoughts they hover on the outskirts
  
I guess it says a lot about me
I'm just a bit shattered, i plea
well its nothing new
its happened before, its true
I didn't learn the first time
It feels like a war-crime
its not though
just because its a devastating blow
doesn't make it any worse of a crime
  
i sit here in a puddle of tears
wishing away the years
thought id found the one
you shone brighter than the sun
I thought I could trust you
I thought you trusted
I had that all wrong didn't I?
ah well, I'm the fool
