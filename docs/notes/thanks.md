[[Landing]] [[My Poems]] [[favorite]] #fav

# thanks :)

You were the best friend I ever had
I guess that’s why it hurts so bad
Why did you do it? was it all a skit?
Are you simply full of it?
You were so good to me
When we talked, I felt carefree

I trusted you, you let me down
Why did you cause me so much pain?
I found the answer, it’s quite simple
I’m naive, and you’re young
And so our relationship- it hung

A simple mistake, easily made
But the price of it can never be weighed 
For what is the price of unbroken trust?
It’s higher than anything, even angel dust
  
So thanks for all the times we had
Thanks for being a wonderful comrade 
Thanks for all the things you said
I’ll treasure them all in my head

I’d do it again, if given the chance 
What an unfortunate circumstance 
I’ll always treasure the times we had
You made me so glad
It’s over now, and now I’m sad
But it’s alright, it’s not too bad

i wanna thank you
for everything you did
for everything you said

you helped me a lot
you hurt me a lot

thank you for the best month of my life
thank you for being my friend
cause you were amazing
maybe you loved me
if you did why did you hurt me?

i sit here in a puddle of tears
wishing away the years
thought id found the one
one that i could trust
one that trusted me

everything you said to me
well i took it to heart
and now my heart 
its shattered
