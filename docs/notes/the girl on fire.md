the girl on fire 
.
.
.
A shining point, a burning fire
a pretty light casting away the night.
People look on and admire
as she runs, she glimmers bright.

She's wreathed in fire -
it bursts forth from every step.
Her eyes are glowing in deathly ire.
everywhere that she flees

people people pause and stare in awe-
at the girl on fire.
People learn to fear her heat,
she burns everything she touches.

People blister and they cast her out,
she runs away- her path revealed in fire.
Always lonely and destined to maim -
I'm the girl dressed in flame.
