What have I done?

What have I done on this fine day?
I've frittered all my time away. 
A minute here, a minute there,
It simply faded in the air. 
  
What have I done on this fine day? 
I've made a wish upon a star,
and I see you standing from afar. 
I wish that I could hold you tight, 
And hug away all the fright. 
  
What have I done on this fine day? 
I've written a poem to show my dismay. 
Line by line, I set in stone, 
The wasteful day that I bemoan. 
  
What have I done on this fine day? 
I've eaten food that I didn’t earn. 
It isn’t what I truly yearn.
I force it down; it tastes like dust. 
I just want to earn my own measly crust. 

What have I done on this fine day? 
I've frittered all my time away.
