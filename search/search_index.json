Not literally, but I have fought for and won control of my life. I come from a family that was strongly against LGBTQ+, I was raised in isolation and homeschooled up until college. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted in life because I didn\u2019t have any experience in the real world, so I let my parents tell me where to go to college. I started at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2019, and the residential life was eye opening in terms of gaining my independence.. It was a completely different lifestyle, and I learned to be self-reliant. I took on my identity as my own person during that first year. There were several key realizations: Firstly, I was not an engineer and yet I was at an engineering school. Secondly, I am trans. Because I\u2019m from a conservative family, coming to terms with being trans was absolutely the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I knew that I could not come out to my family - they would not support me. My university also stifled my identity, with little to no resources in terms of diversity, and I was the only trans person on campus to my knowledge. I felt as though I had no way out. My roommates and parents were homophobic. I was terrified I\u2019d be attacked, I was miserable. I couldn\u2019t safely transition. I was close to giving up. At some point, I realized that I had gained enough essential life skills to be able to leave the abusive environment and have a good chance of succeeding. I spent about a month planning everything before flying to New York City. Leaving was a huge relief. I am able to function as my own person, transition, I\u2019m with people who support me instead of hate me. I lived in emergency housing at a shelter while I worked out benefits such as health insurance, medication, and housing. I found a free sailboat named Crescenda on Craigslist, which I then fixed up, and I\u2019m currently writing this essay from. It doesn\u2019t have electricity, running water, or heat, but I have thick blankets, and it\u2019s better than the emergency housing at the shelter. Even though you may think that these are rather poor living conditions, I am wealthier than most in terms of freedom. I have sacrificed a lot of time and energy to get to a place where I can live out my own life and transition.","title":"Crescenda to Crescendo"},{"location":"notes/Defining%20Religion%2C%20Mythos%2C%20Logos%2C%20Suffering/","tags":["published"],"text":"landing philosophy \u2014 SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DffqK6j-y1U Mythos how to cope with loss how to endure pain meaningfully Dostoevsky , Cervantes , religion, Shakespeare , all provide insight into Mythos.

For example - students forget a lot of what they have learned in class. The brain is an amazing organ - it\u2019s great at processing information what color is your shirt? - takes nearly zero effort to determine, but remembering things for long periods is much harder: what did you eat for breakfast yesterday? Interestingly despite this well-known fact, nobody has come up with an elegant solution to this problem, instead opting to hammer the knowledge into people\u2019s heads for years with pain and suffering. I would suggest that the most important things that students learn in college boil down to training the brain on how to approach a problem. Perhaps this isn\u2019t true for all majors, but it does appear to be true for mine. I have grown frustrated with needing to recall knowledge and find memorizing facts - separate from concepts and ideas) to be tedious and painful. What if, instead of teaching about the American Revolution; give people a list of terms such as the French Revolution, the American Revolution, and the Spanish Inquisition? Have them write down some key facts about each, and then use the class period to discuss how they affected each other? I\u2019d recommend against assigning a textbook because that limits the variety of knowledge the students will gather. Give bonus points for unique and unusual facts that they dig up. This method would be great, except that most of the students will promptly throw that piece of paper away or put it in a binder and forget it exists. They won\u2019t remember any of the details except the most surprising ones, and it will be almost as though you never had a class. What if, instead of throwing the paper away, students integrated it into a digital brain, containing detailed notes on the terms? that way, in the future, they could easily and quickly search for the term, and pull up their exact thoughts about it from many years ago when it was fresh on their mind? Would it not be even better than the greatest possible lecture? What if I told you that this system already exists, that I have been using it for several months, and that I have had great success with Obsidian? I believe that a combination of online wiki software, with the Zettelkasten method results in a sort of digital brain that stores highly detailed information about the things you have learned, and provides extremely quick access for any future needs. the only drawback is that it takes a significant overhead to input everything into this system. I have seen my typing speed increase from 60wpm to 85 wpm in 3 months and it\u2019s still not enough to keep up. I believe the solution to this is to reinvent the keyboard - potentially using Charachorder - a new system that claims to let people type at 300 wpm. I use Obsidian- a digital wiki that stores its notes in Md format. I plan on spending the summer optimizing my Obsidian knowledgebase and researching better ways to type faster. side tracked \u00b6 I would argue that in this digital age, information is basically free, but a lot of the free information is either low level and missing important details, or simply diluted with fluff.

The process for creating these links is the most important piece of learning because knowing something without being able to apply that knowledge to a problem makes that knowledge useless. Links are built in a few different ways. By far the best way, to create brain links is to need the knowledge and enjoy working on it. Perhaps the second-best way is to repeatedly expose yourself to the knowledge over several days, with several hour-long gaps. Pain is Not the Unit of Effort \u00b6 Pain is not the unit of effort There seems to be a philosophy that suffering is a good measure of how hard someone is trying. Good examples of this are famous quotes such as, \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d If you think something\u2019s supposed to hurt, you\u2019re less likely to notice if you\u2019re doing it wrong. For example, if you are working out and just assume it\u2019s supposed to hurt, you may keep running on a sprained ankle and injure it even more. 1. Don\u2019t Try Harder - Try Smarter \u00b6 This isn\u2019t to say that you don\u2019t need to try hard, just that putting effort into optimizing the effort is just as important as the actual effort. Both are needed for success, and trying harder to the point that you are miserable is counterproductive. It turns out that pain used to be a pretty good estimate of effort in the past. It took most of the average person\u2019s day to get through their chores, and so anything on top of that was painful because they would much rather rest/sleep. This isn\u2019t true any more thanks to modern technology allowing us to spend vastly less time doing menial tasks. This is only true in 1st world countries though. It also happens that using pain as the unit of effort has disastrous consequences for the average person\u2019s mental health. \u201cMy brain may be artificially injecting unpleasantness into effort. When engaged in activities that fall into the category of \u201cwork\u201d I think my brain adds additional, unnecessary doses of drowsiness, anxiety, and feelings of low status and low agency.

I should think\u2026 how cool is it that I get PAID to work on this interesting problem!! The latter would induce feelings of interest, and interest leads to motivation, and motivation leads to work being done on the problem, and work getting done leads to feelings of satisfaction and happiness. \u201cYou hang onto your pain like it means something, like it\u2019s worth something. Well, let me tell \u2018ya, it\u2019s not worth shit. Let it go.\u201d \u2014 Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. I feel like this is an interesting quote. Pain is only worth something if you can learn from it. you burn your hand on the stove - you hopefully learn not to touch the stove! very effective and useful. However, in the grand scheme of things.... it would be just as effective for your parent to say don\u2019t touch the stove it will burn you. This would avoid all the pain and suffering associated with touching the hot stove. in the end, I think whenever I find something that causes me suffering, I should reflect on it, try to learn something from it, and then Let It Go. source Raising the Happiness Set Point \u00b6 raising the happiness set point Goal: increase the baseline average happiness (serotonin) levels.

I mean that I spend enormous effort looking for a solution that requires less effort, time, money, or parts. I think that this causes problems in my math classes because usually there isn\u2019t a simpler solution, and I waste a lot of effort trying to find a simpler way. It\u2019s very helpful in other life aspects though. note: dad says that I probably picked this method up from him since that\u2019s his default as well the math method \u00b6 A much more helpful problem-solving method for math problems would be to try the first method that pops into my head. it\u2019s almost always right, even if it doesn\u2019t feel very efficient. I need to follow my intuition rather than grinding through and proving that I have the simplest answer. It will save me a lot of time, however, at the moment, I\u2019ve trained myself to push that first solution aside automatically and look for a better one. the programming method \u00b6 for computer science/programming problems, it\u2019s a lot better to do as much thinking as possible before actually coding. I need to be able to run the problem in my head for simple problems, or with the help of pseudo-code for complex problems. It would also be beneficial to write out the pseudo-code, and then refactor it before writing the program. (this would save me total time if I plan to refactor anyway) the goal is to get all the ideas straight before coding the problem because changing the real code is a pain and changing pseudo-code is easy. switch thought modes \u00b6 Figure out how to switch between modes of thinking. Kinda like speaking 3 different languages I\u2019m currently really bad at this, and I need to figure it out ASAP how sleep affects thinking \u00b6 I believe that sleeping helps organize the brain(think renaming files, putting them in the right subfolders, adding internal links, etc). If you just kept all your files in one massive folder, eventually you would be unable to function cause you couldn\u2019t find anything. this is the same with your brain. I think that careful organization of your thoughts and keeping a tidy mind can lead you to need less sleep, and/or feel more rested. There isn\u2019t any evidence of this, but I am collecting data on sleep in bd sleep tracking . It is the case that too little sleep fogs the brain, so sleep is critical in terms of keeping a well-running brain.

I think that careful thought about what you believe is essential to knowing your purpose in life. I will first give a definition, and an example of each philosophy, and then dive into the differences between them. rationality \u00b6 In order to dissect the role that rationality has in stoicism, one must first have a firm grasp on what rationality is. I will seek to write a concise description of rationality. the textbook definition claims that it is The view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge. For example, a rationalist will usually flat out refuse to believe things that do not have a basis in the scientific method, or require faith. stoicism \u00b6 Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. For example - A stoic when confronted with an injustice would seek to put on a calm and collected face, and negotiate the problem, without releasing emotions such as anger, frustration or hate, instead seeking to exhibit compassion, understanding, and patience. Imagine\u2026 say, someone treats you in a way that you perceive as unfair. An emotional reaction would cause you to escalate the situation and perhaps yell at the person. If the person had more self control, then they might perhaps hold back the emotions in recognition that they will not help the situation, and will not achieve anything positive. A rationalist would seek to make the most rational decision regarding the conflict. Walk away? Escalate if needed? perhaps go find the manager and complain? A Stoic would accept the situation as it is, and perhaps if future interactions with this person are likely, would seek to either repair the relationship, or take steps to avoid interaction with this person. I personally believe that escalating the situation is almost always a bad thing. I believe that this leans more towards a stoic view of the world. I however believe that if I could get the person who mistreated me fired, that would keep them from mistreating myself again, and also keep them from mistreating others. I think this is more of a rationalist approach. I think that this goes against stoicism, since this uses a potentially destructive emotion (revenge). I think based on these examples that rationalists can also be stoics, in the fact that rationality requires a High amount of self-control, and emotional control. However stoicism differs on the fact that Rationalists embrace all emotions as long as they make sense from a logical standpoint. I\u2019d argue that Rationalism is a less restrictive form of stoicism, with a focus on making logical, informed decisions.

I will seek to write a concise description of rationality. the textbook definition claims that it is The view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge. For example, a rationalist will usually flat out refuse to believe things that do not have a basis in the scientific method, or require faith.","title":"rationality"},{"location":"notes/essay%20on%20rationality%20and%20its%20role%20in%20stoicism/#stoicism","text":"Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. For example - A stoic when confronted with an injustice would seek to put on a calm and collected face, and negotiate the problem, without releasing emotions such as anger, frustration or hate, instead seeking to exhibit compassion, understanding, and patience. Imagine\u2026 say, someone treats you in a way that you perceive as unfair. An emotional reaction would cause you to escalate the situation and perhaps yell at the person. If the person had more self control, then they might perhaps hold back the emotions in recognition that they will not help the situation, and will not achieve anything positive. A rationalist would seek to make the most rational decision regarding the conflict. Walk away? Escalate if needed? perhaps go find the manager and complain? A Stoic would accept the situation as it is, and perhaps if future interactions with this person are likely, would seek to either repair the relationship, or take steps to avoid interaction with this person. I personally believe that escalating the situation is almost always a bad thing. I believe that this leans more towards a stoic view of the world. I however believe that if I could get the person who mistreated me fired, that would keep them from mistreating myself again, and also keep them from mistreating others. I think this is more of a rationalist approach. I think that this goes against stoicism, since this uses a potentially destructive emotion (revenge). I think based on these examples that rationalists can also be stoics, in the fact that rationality requires a High amount of self-control, and emotional control. However stoicism differs on the fact that Rationalists embrace all emotions as long as they make sense from a logical standpoint. I\u2019d argue that Rationalism is a less restrictive form of stoicism, with a focus on making logical, informed decisions.","title":"stoicism"},{"location":"notes/essay%20on%20rationality%20and%20its%20role%20in%20stoicism/#difficulties","text":"The mind is inherently illogical, and most people are not rational. they do what feels best instead of what is actually best for them.
