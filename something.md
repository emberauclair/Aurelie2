# Something

There’s something about you that I can’t quite place

Maybe it’s that wistful look on your face.

How do you manage to be carefree?

Maybe it’s the way you smile at me.

You reserve that smile for me alone,

It strikes a chord in my heart of stone.

Maybe it’s the way you sit over there,

Refusing a perfectly serviceable chair.

Maybe it’s the way you brighten the room,

Whenever you walk into the gloom.

Whatever it is that I can’t quite place,

It never fails to make my heart race.
